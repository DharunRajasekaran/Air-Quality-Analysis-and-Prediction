üåç Air Quality Analysis and Prediction üå´Ô∏èüìä‚ú®

Project Description

This project explores air quality across multiple cities using data science techniques. By analyzing pollutant concentrations, weather conditions, and their relationships, the project uncovers insights into air quality trends and predicts future air quality levels (AQI).

Key features of this project include:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Visualization (heatmaps, line plots, bar plots, histograms)

Predictive Modeling (Random Forest Regressor)

Feature Importance Analysis

Time-Series Analysis

Features

1. Dataset

The dataset contains synthetic air quality data for 8 cities across 80 days. It includes the following features:

Cities: New York, Los Angeles, Beijing, Mumbai, Sydney, London, Tokyo, Cairo

Pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3

Weather Metrics: Temperature, Humidity

Air Quality Index (AQI): Derived from pollutant levels

2. Techniques Used

Correlation Analysis: Identifies relationships between pollutants, weather conditions, and AQI.

Clustering: Groups cities by average pollutant levels.

Predictive Modeling: Random Forest Regressor predicts AQI based on pollutants and weather.

Time-Series Analysis: Analyzes monthly AQI trends and predicts future values.

3. Visualizations

Pollutant Trends: Line plots showcasing PM2.5 levels over time.

AQI Distribution: Histogram of AQI values.

Correlation Heatmap: Displays relationships between pollutants, weather, and AQI.

Feature Importance: Highlights the impact of each variable on AQI prediction.

Future AQI Prediction: Line plot for predicted AQI values.
